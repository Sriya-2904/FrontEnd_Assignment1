Assignment for beginners
Front-end development is all about creating the parts of a website that users interact with directly. It involves designing and building the layout, visual elements, and overall user experience. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are essential tools in this process. HTML provides the structure of a web page, defining elements like text, images, and links. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style and arrange these elements, ensuring the page looks good and functions well. Together, HTML and CSS allow developers to create visually appealing and well-organized websites.
